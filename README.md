Hello
My name is Yuha Yoo and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor. 
I hope to use my experience to work on side projects and perhaps larger scale projects as well. 
Some of my interests are in navigation software and electronics like chart plotters and sonar on boats. 
I also enjoy working with computer simulations like FEA and CFD to solve complex engineering problems.
